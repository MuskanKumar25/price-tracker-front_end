			<p><b>Welcome to our website! Here is a little about us.</b> <br><br><br>

Our price tracker keeps track of the product that the user wants to purchase at a particular or specific price.<br>
When the desired product's price drops to a specified amount, it notifies the user via the registered email.<br>
Our website helps users to save time as they don't need to manually open the ecommerce website again again and check the drop in it's price every day.<br>
They just need to copy the URL of their desired product and add to our tracker and as soon as it's price drops,<br> the user gets notified and can buy it before everyone else does or before it gets out of stock!<br>
And here's a plus point to all of this. Users can add unlimited products from the internet for which he/she wants to track the price<br> and enjoy their online shopping in the best way possible!</p>
